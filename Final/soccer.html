    <h3>About My Soccer Passion</h3>
    <p>
        I've been playing soccer for 16 years and have played in both the competitive 
        and recreational scenes. My recent years have been my favorite because I feel like 
        I’ve grown into a strong player and a solid leader. This year, I played for Fountain City FC 
        and was the captain of the first team. It was an amazing season, and I met so many of my friends 
        through that team.
    </p>
    <p>
        Playing soccer has taught me teamwork, discipline, and leadership. It helped me grow out of my 
        introverted ways and pushed me to become more confident and outgoing.

    <h3>Future</h3>
    <p>
        My future in soccer isn’t huge since I quit playing competitively, but I still play in a men’s 
        league—and honestly, it’s a blast. Playing with all the guys is fun, and I’ve met even more 
        lifelong friends through it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Growing up, I used to dream about starting my own soccer business—creating a place where people 
        could come, hang out, and just play the sport they love.
