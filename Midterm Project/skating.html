    <h3>About My Skating Passion</h3>
    <p>I love being active, learning new skills, and challenging myself. So skating or scootering in my sense is my favorite thing to challenge myself with.
        Learning new tricks is both challenging to my mental game and my persistence. The feeling of learning a new trick is the best feeling in the world.
    </p>
    <p>skating helps me stay creative and push past limits. I love being creative and learning new tricks and lines on the skatepark. My favorite way to
        skate is to go out in the streets and find spots to skate in public.

    <h3>Future</h3>
    <p> My future in skating is bright because I think its my biggest passion and my whole friend group does it.
    </p>
    <p>My dream is to get good enough to be able to go out whenever I want and just ride my scooter around when I can.
