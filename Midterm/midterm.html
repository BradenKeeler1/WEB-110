    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>Hi! I'm a student currently learning the basics of HTML and CSS. Outside of coding, two of my biggest passions are soccer and riding my scooter.
        Whether I'm out on the field or at the skatepark, I love being active, learning new skills, and challenging myself.</p>
    <p>Playing soccer has taught me teamwork and discipline, while skating helps me stay creative and push past limits. im now bringing that same energy into web development
        —learning how to build and design websites from the ground up.</p>

    <h3>Future</h3>
    <p>Right now, I’m focused on learning everything I can about design, development, and digital strategy. I enjoy creating clean, responsive websites that don’t just look good, but actually help people
        whether that’s a personal blog, a small business, or a startup.
    </p>
    <p>My dream is to turn this passion into a business of my own, where I can work with clients to bring their ideas to life online.
        I’m currently building my portfolio and taking on projects to gain real-world experience and sharpen my skills.
    </p>
