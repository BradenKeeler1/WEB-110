    <h3>About my Soccer Passion</h3>
    <p>Ive been playing soccer for 16 years and have played in both the competitive scene and the recreational scene. My recent years of soccer have been my favorite
        because I think I have grown to be a very good player and a good leader aswell. I played for fountain city fc this year and was the captain of the fist team.
        It was a very fun year and I met so many of my friends threw that team.
    </p>
    <p>Playing soccer has taught me teamwork and discipline, I have grown to be a better leader and to be less of a follower and also have grown out of 
        my introverted ways.</p>

    <h3>Future</h3>
    <p> My future in soccer isnt much because I quit and now am just playing in a mens league. I think that its a lot of fun and I have a blast playing with all the guys.
        Ive met some other life long friends through that aswell and im grateful that I have.
    </p>
    <p> Grouwing up I used to want to start my own soccer business and run it myself. I always dreamed on making a place where people can just come and play.
